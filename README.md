Here we presented the research paper - “An Umbrella Converse for Data Exchange: Applied to Caching, Computing, and Shuffling “
The model of the paper is to study the problem of data exchange in a networked environment aiming to derive lower bounds and converses for various settings and scenarios with a focus on the application of coded caching, computing, and shuffling using mathematical and information-theoretic techniques.
